# My personal website

A source code of my personal website which can be found at [sarka.rocks](https://sarka.rocks). *Isn't my URL awesome?*

As every other personal website, this is a never-ending project which I'm never satisfied with. Every time I make some re-design, I immediately start to hate the whole thing and want to start over.

Anyway, here are the technicalities...

## Technologies
* Good ol' **HTML / CSS**
* **Sass** (just a little of it)
* PostCSS's plugin **[postcss-combine-media-query](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-combine-media-query)**
* **[anime.js](https://github.com/juliangarnier/anime)** library for cool animations
* **[Waypoints](https://github.com/imakewebthings/waypoints)** library so those cool animations play when a human scrolls to them as otherwise they would be pretty pointless lol
* On the hosting, I'm using GZIP compression + cache control
* Woff2 font acquired by the amazing [google-webfonts-helper](https://github.com/majodev/google-webfonts-helper)

üèÜ The whole site scores 100 points in every area on PageSpeed Insights which I'm pretty proud of. *And if you'll now try it and it won't have 100s everywhere, I blame current Google's mood swing.*

## To-do
* implement prefers-reduced-motion
* the CSS files are pretty messy right now in terms of division so I may look into that
* maybe some projects / blog sections in the future
* I've been thinking about making it SPA in the future but... dunno
* some SEO optimisation
